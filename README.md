## Results
| Method           | Approximate Root | Converged in Iterations |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Bisection        | 2.000000         | 1                        |
| Newton–Raphson   | 2.000000         | 5                        |
| Secant           | 2.000000         | 6                        |

All methods converged to the same correct root (**x = 2**).  
The Newton–Raphson method achieved the fastest convergence.
