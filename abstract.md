# Abstract

The present project studies three numerical techniques—**Bisection**, **Newton–Raphson**, and **Secant Methods**—used to approximate the roots of nonlinear equations.  
These algorithms have become indispensable tools in computational mathematics since many equations cannot be solved analytically due to complexity or impossibility of closed-form evaluation.

Each method was implemented and tested using **GNU Octave 10.3.0** to determine its convergence behavior, accuracy, and computational efficiency.  
Through iterative procedures, each algorithm refined an initial estimate until it approached the actual root within a predefined tolerance.

The project compares the strengths and limitations of each approach.  
While all methods successfully converged to the same root (**x = 2**), the **Newton–Raphson method** achieved the fastest convergence rate.  
The results highlight how numerical methods serve as practical and reliable tools in **science, engineering, and computer applications**, enabling the solution of complex problems that are otherwise analytically unsolvable.
