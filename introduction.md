# Introduction

The field of **Numerical Analysis** provides systematic techniques to find approximate solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically.  
This project focuses on solving nonlinear equations of the form:

\[
f(x) = 0
\]

where the root \(x\) represents the point at which the function crosses the x-axis.  
Such problems are common in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering—especially when exact algebraic solutions are impractical or impossible to obtain.

To address this, three numerical methods are explored and compared in this study:  
**Bisection**, **Newton–Raphson**, and **Secant Methods**.  
These algorithms use iterative procedures to gradually approach the true root of the function by improving an initial approximation at each step.

The goal of this project is to:
- Demonstrate the implementation of each method using computational tools such as **GNU Octave** (compatible with MATLAB).  
- Compare their performance based on convergence speed, accuracy, and number of iterations.  
- Illustrate their applications in computer science and engineering fields.

This work aims to help students understand not only the mechanics of numerical algorithms but also their practical importance in real-world problem-solving, optimization, and simulation processes.
