# Comparison of Methods  

This section compares the three numerical methods used in this project — **Bisection**, **Newton–Raphson**, and **Secant** — based on how they find the root, their rate of convergence, and overall behavior.  
Although all three methods aim to solve \( f(x) = 0 \), they differ in how the next value \( x_{i+1} \) is calculated from previous iterations.

---

## 5.1 Bisection Method  

- The **Bisection Method** starts with two values \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( f(a) \times f(b) < 0 \).  
- The midpoint is found by:  
  $$
  x_{i+1} = \frac{a + b}{2}
  $$  
- The new interval is then selected based on the sign of \( f(x_{i+1}) \).  
- This process repeats until the difference between \( a \) and \( b \) becomes very small.

**Main Points:**  
- Converges **slowly but always works** if \( f(a)f(b) < 0 \).  
- Does **not need derivatives**.  
- Each step cuts the interval in half.

---

## 5.2 Newton–Raphson Method  

- The **Newton–Raphson Method** uses the tangent line to find where the function crosses the x-axis.  
- Starting from an initial guess \( x_0 \), it applies the formula:  
  $$
  x_{i+1} = x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}
  $$  
- The next value \( x_{i+1} \) is where the tangent line at \( (x_i, f(x_i)) \) meets the x-axis.

**Main Points:**  
- **Very fast** convergence if the first guess is close to the actual root.  
- Needs the **first derivative** \( f'(x) \).  
- Might **diverge** if \( f'(x_i) = 0 \) or if the first guess is poor.

---

## 5.3 Secant Method  

- The **Secant Method** is similar to Newton–Raphson but uses two previous points instead of a derivative.  
- The formula is:  
  $$
  x_{i+1} = x_i - f(x_i) \frac{x_i - x_{i-1}}{f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})}
  $$  
- It uses the slope of the secant line between \( (x_{i-1}, f(x_{i-1})) \) and \( (x_i, f(x_i)) \).

**Main Points:**  
- **Faster** than Bisection but a bit **slower** than Newton–Raphson.  
- **No derivative** is required.  
- Can fail if \( f(x_i) \) and \( f(x_{i-1}) \) are nearly the same.

## 5.4 Summary of Comparison  

| **Feature** | **Bisection** | **Newton–Raphson** | **Secant** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Derivative Required** | No | Yes | No |
| **Initial Guesses** | Two points \( a, b \) | One point \( x_0 \) | Two points \( x_0, x_1 \) |
| **Formula** | \( x_{i+1} = \frac{a + b}{2} \) | \( x_{i+1} = x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)} \) | \( x_{i+1} = x_i - f(x_i) \frac{x_i - x_{i-1}}{f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})} \) |
| **Convergence Speed** | Slow | Fast | Moderate |
| **Stability** | Always convergent | May diverge | May diverge |
| **Ease of Use** | Very Easy | Moderate | Easy |

## 5.5 Final Remarks  

- The **Bisection Method** is the safest and always converges but is the slowest.  
- The **Newton–Raphson Method** is the fastest and most accurate if the derivative is available.  
- The **Secant Method** provides a balance — it is faster than Bisection and simpler than Newton–Raphson.  

Overall, the **Newton–Raphson method** performed best in this project because it reached the correct root in fewer iterations, while all three methods produced the same final result (**x = 2**).
