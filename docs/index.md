## Project Title
**Comparison of Numerical Methods for Solving Nonlinear Equations**  
*(Bisection, Newton–Raphson, and Secant Methods)*  

---

## Abstract  

This project studies three numerical methods — **Bisection**, **Newton–Raphson**, and **Secant** — to find the root of nonlinear equations that cannot be solved exactly.  
Each method was implemented using **GNU Octave**, and the results were compared based on convergence speed, accuracy, and stability.  

All three methods reached the same correct root (**x = 2**).  
The **Newton–Raphson Method** converged the fastest, followed by **Secant**, while **Bisection** remained the most reliable though slower.

---

## Objectives  
1. Apply and compare classical numerical root-finding methods.  
2. Study their convergence rate, accuracy, and computational efficiency.  
3. Display results through tables and graphs.  
4. Strengthen understanding of iterative numerical analysis through practical implementation.

## Methods Used  
| Method | Description | Characteristics |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Bisection Method** | Divides an interval repeatedly to locate the root. | Slow but guaranteed convergence. |
| **Newton–Raphson Method** | Uses tangent lines based on derivatives to find the root. | Fast but requires a good initial guess. |
| **Secant Method** | Approximates the derivative using two points. | Moderate speed and simple to implement. |

## Results Summary  

| Method | Approximate Root | Iterations |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Bisection** | 2.000000 | 1 |
| **Newton–Raphson** | 2.000000 | 5 |
| **Secant** | 2.000000 | 6 |

All methods converged to the same root (**x = 2**).  
The **Newton–Raphson Method** was the fastest, confirming the theory discussed in class.
